[discussing his problems]
I don't know what to do, Godfather. My voice is weak, it's weak. Anyway, if I had this part in the picture, it puts me right back on top, you know. But this... this man out there. He won't give it to me, the head of the studio. 
Don Corleone:
What's his name? 
Don Corleone:
Woltz. He said there's no chance, no chance... 
[Meanwhile, Hagen finds Sonny and summons him]

Johnny Fontane:
A month ago he bought the rights to this book, a best seller. The main character is a guy just like me. I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself. Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do... 
[All of a sudden, Don Corleone rises from his chair and gives Fontane a savage shake]

Don Corleone:
YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN! 
[gives a quick slap to Fontane]

Don Corleone:
What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! 
[the Don's unexpected mimicry makes Hagen and even Fontane laugh; around this time Sonny comes in]

Don Corleone:
Tell me, do you spend time with your family? 
Johnny Fontane:
Sure I do. 
Don Corleone:
Good. Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. 
[gives a quick look at Sonny and affectionately embraces Fontane]

Don Corleone:
You look terrible. I want you to eat, I want you to rest well. And a month from now this Hollywood big shot's gonna give you what you want. 
Johnny Fontane:
Too late. They start shooting in a week. 
Don Corleone:
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Okay? I want you to leave it all to me. Go on, go back to the party. 
[a gratified Fontane leaves]
